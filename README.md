⚠️ CRLF/LF Warning Explanation
While committing on Windows, Git warns:

lua
Copy
Edit
LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
This is harmless and just tells you Git is converting Unix-style line endings (LF) to Windows-style (CRLF). It won't affect your code or deployment.

To suppress this warning in the future:

bash
Copy
Edit
git config --global core.autocrlf true
📁 Folder Structure (Simplified)
java
Copy

/client       ← React frontend
/server       ← Node.js + Express backend
  └─ models   ← Mongoose models (e.g., Resume.js, Contact.js)
  └─ routes   ← API route files (resumeRoutes.js, contact.js, userRoutes.js)
.env          ← Environment variables (MONGO_URI, etc.)
package.json  ← Backend dependencies
client/package.json ← Frontend dependencies
